<h1>Herodian 8.4</h1>
</header>
<div id="antescript"><p><a href="https://www.livius.org/articles/person/herodian/"><strong>Herodian</strong></a> (late second, first half third century): Greek historian, author of a <em>History of the Roman Empire since the Death of Marcus Aurelius</em> in which he describes the reign of Commodus (180-192), the Year of the Five Emperors (193), the age of the Severan dynasty (211-235), and the Year of the Six Emperors (238).</p>
<p>The translation was made by Edward C. Echols (<em>Herodian of Antioch's History of the Roman Empire</em>, 1961 Berkeley and Los Angeles) and was put online for the first time by Roger Pearse (<a href="http://www.tertullian.org/">Tertullian.Org</a>). The version offered on these pages is hyperlinked and contains notes by Jona Lendering.</p></div><hr class="ancient-text"><h3>Failure of the Siege of Aquileia</h3>
<p><span id="8.4.1">[8.4.1]</span>&nbsp;<span class="verse"><span style="color:rgb(0,153,0);">[April 238]</span> </span>When the envoys returned unsuccessful, <a href="https://www.livius.org/articles/person/maximinus-thrax/">Maximinus</a>, in a towering rage, pressed on toward the city with increased speed. But when he came to a large river sixteen miles from <a href="/articles/place/aquileia/">Aquileia</a>,<span class="note-label" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; togglenote('note385993991-1682378657-0');" title="Click to toggle note" data-cf-modified-0a64e4b53c73211b0f9cc94a-=""><sup>note</sup></span><span id="note385993991-1682378657-0" class="note-content" style="display: none;">[The Isonzo.]</span> he found it flowing very wide and very deep.</p><p><span id="8.4.2">[8.4.2]</span>&nbsp;The warmth at that season of the year had melted the mountain snow that had been frozen all winter, and a vast, snow-swollen flood had resulted. It was impossible for Maximinus' army to cross this river because the Aquileians had destroyed the bridge, a huge structure of imposing proportions built, by earlier emperors, of squared stones and supported on tapering piers. Since neither bridges nor boats were available, the army halted in confusion.</p><p><span id="8.4.3">[8.4.3]</span>&nbsp;Some of the Germans, unfamiliar with the swift, violent rivers of Italy and thinking that these flowed down to the plains as lazily as their own streams (it is the slow current of the German rivers which causes them to freeze over), entered the river with their horses, which are trained to swim, and were carried away and drowned.</p><p><span id="8.4.4">[8.4.4]</span>&nbsp;After a ditch had been dug around the camp to prevent attacks, Maximinus halted for two or three days beside the river, considering how it might be bridged. Timber was scarce, and there were no boats which could be fastened together to span the river. Some of his engineers, however, called attention to the many empty wooden kegs scattered about the deserted fields, the barrels which the natives use to ship wine safely to those forced to import it. The kegs are hollow, like boats; when fastened together and anchored to the shore by cables, they float like pontoons, and the current cannot carry them off. Planks are laid on top of these pontoons, and with great skill and speed a bank of earth is piled up evenly on the platform thus fashioned.</p><p><span id="8.4.5">[8.4.5]</span>&nbsp;After the bridge had been completed, the army crossed over and marched to Aquileia, where they found the buildings on the outskirts deserted. The soldiers cut down all the trees and grapevines and burned them, and destroyed the crops which had already begun to appear in those regions. Since the trees were planted in even rows and the interwoven vines linked them together everywhere, the countryside had a festive air; one might even say that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it wore a garland of green.<span class="note-label" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; togglenote('note2121442571-1682378657-0');" title="Click to toggle note" data-cf-modified-0a64e4b53c73211b0f9cc94a-=""><sup>note</sup></span><span id="note2121442571-1682378657-0" class="note-content" style="display: none;">[These lyrical lines appear to be a quotation from a poem.]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All these trees and vines Maximinus' soldiers cut down to the very roots before they hurried up to the walls of Aquileia.</p><p><span id="8.4.6">[8.4.6]</span>&nbsp;The army was exhausted, however, and it seemed wiser not to launch an immediate attack. The soldiers therefore remained out of range of the arrows and took up stations around the entire circuit of the wall by cohorts and legions, each unit investing the section it was ordered to hold. After a single day's rest, the soldiers kept the city under continuous siege for the remaining time.</p>
<p>They brought up every type of siege machinery and attacked the wall with all the power they could muster, leaving untried nothing of the art of siege warfare.</p><p><span id="8.4.7">[8.4.7]</span>&nbsp;They launched numerous assaults virtually every day, and the entire army held the city encircled as if in a net, but the Aquileians fought back determinedly, showing real enthusiasm for war. They had closed their houses and temples and were fighting in a body, together with the women and children, from their advantageous position on the parapet and in the towers. In this way they held off their attackers, and no one was too young or too old to take part in the battle to preserve his native city.</p><p><span id="8.4.8">[8.4.8]</span>&nbsp;All the buildings in the suburbs and outside the city gates were demolished by Maximinus' men, and the wood from the houses was used to build the siege engines. The soldiers made every effort to destroy a part of the wall, so that the army might break in, seize everything, and, after leveling the city, leave the area a deserted pasture land. The journey to Rome would not be fittingly glorious if Maximinus failed to capture the first city in Italy to oppose him.</p><p><span id="8.4.9">[8.4.9]</span>&nbsp;By pleading and promising gifts, Maximinus and his son, whom he had appointed his <a href="https://www.livius.org/articles/concept/caesar/" style="font-style:italic;">caesar</a>, spurred the army to action; they rode about on horseback, encouraging the soldiers to fight with resolution. The Aquileians hurled down stones on the besiegers; combining pitch and olive oil with asphalt and brimstone, they ignited this mixture and poured it over their attackers from hollow vessels fitted with long handles. Bringing the flaming liquid to the walls, they scattered it over the soldiers like a heavy downpour of rain.</p><p><span id="8.4.10">[8.4.10]</span>&nbsp;Carried along with the other ingredients, the pitch oozed onto the unprotected parts of the soldiers' bodies and spread everywhere. Then the soldiers ripped off their blazing corselets and the rest of their armor too, for the iron grew red hot, and the leather and wooden parts caught fire and burned. As a result, soldiers were seen everywhere stripping themselves, and the discarded armor appeared like the spoils of war, but these were taken by cunning and treachery, not by courage on the field of battle. In this tragedy, most of the soldiers suffered scarred and disfigured faces and lost eyes and hands, while every unprotected part of the body was severely injured. The Aquileians hurled down torches on the siege engines which had been dragged up to the walls. These torches, sharpened at the end like a javelin, were soaked in pitch and resin and then ignited; the firebrands, still blazing, stuck fast in the machines, which easily caught fire and were consumed by the flames.</p>
