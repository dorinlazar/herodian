<h1>Herodian 8.5</h1>
</header>
<div id="antescript"><p><a href="https://www.livius.org/articles/person/herodian/"><strong>Herodian</strong></a> (late second, first half third century): Greek historian, author of a <em>History of the Roman Empire since the Death of Marcus Aurelius</em> in which he describes the reign of Commodus (180-192), the Year of the Five Emperors (193), the age of the Severan dynasty (211-235), and the Year of the Six Emperors (238).</p>
<p>The translation was made by Edward C. Echols (<em>Herodian of Antioch's History of the Roman Empire</em>, 1961 Berkeley and Los Angeles) and was put online for the first time by Roger Pearse (<a href="http://www.tertullian.org/">Tertullian.Org</a>). The version offered on these pages is hyperlinked and contains notes by Jona Lendering.</p></div><hr class="ancient-text"><h3>Soldiers kill Maximinus</h3>
<p><span id="8.5.1">[8.5.1]</span>&nbsp;<span class="verse"><span style="color:rgb(0,153,0);">[April-May 238]</span> </span>During the opening days, then, the fortunes of war were almost equal. As time passed, however, the army of <a href="https://www.livius.org/articles/person/maximinus-thrax/">Maximinus</a> grew depressed and, cheated in its expectations, fell into despair when the soldiers found that those whom they had not expected to hold out against a single assault were not only offering stout resistance but were even beating them back.</p><p><span id="8.5.2">[8.5.2]</span>&nbsp;The <a href="/articles/place/aquileia/">Aquileians</a>, on the other hand, were greatly encouraged and highly enthusiastic, and, as the battle continued, their skill and daring increased. Contemptuous of the soldiers now, they hurled taunts at them. As Maximinus rode about, they shouted insults and indecent blasphemies at him and his son. The emperor became increasingly angry because he was powerless to retaliate.</p><p><span id="8.5.3">[8.5.3]</span>&nbsp;Unable to vent his wrath upon the enemy, he was enraged at most of his troop commanders because they were pressing the siege in cowardly and halfhearted fashion. Consequently, the hatred of his supporters increased, and his enemies grew more contemptuous of him each day.</p>
<p>As it happened, the Aquileians had everything they needed in abundant quantities. With great foresight they had stored in the city all the food and drink required for men and animals. The soldiers of the emperor, by contrast, lacked every necessity, since they had cut down the fruit trees and devastated the countryside.</p><p><span id="8.5.4">[8.5.4]</span>&nbsp;Some of the soldiers had built temporary huts, but the majority were living in the open air, exposed to sun and rain. And now many died of starvation; no food was brought in from the outside, as the Romans had blocked all the roads of Italy by erecting walls provided with narrow gates.</p><p><span id="8.5.5">[8.5.5]</span>&nbsp;The <a href="https://www.livius.org/articles/concept/senate/">Senate</a> dispatched former <a href="https://www.livius.org/articles/concept/consul/">consuls</a> and picked men from all Italy to guard the beaches and harbors and prevent anyone from sailing. Their intent was to keep Maximinus in ignorance of what was happening at Rome; thus the main roads and all the bypaths were closely watched to prevent anyone's passing. The result was that the army which appeared to be maintaining the siege was itself under siege, for it was unable to capture Aquileia or leave the city and proceed to Rome; all the boats and wagons had been hidden, and no vehicles of any kind were available to the soldiers.</p><p><span id="8.5.6">[8.5.6]</span>&nbsp;Exaggerated rumors were circulated, based only on suspicion, to the effect that the entire Roman people were under arms; that all Italy was united; that the provinces of <a href="/articles/people/illyrians/dalmatia/">Illyricum</a> and the <a href="/articles/concept/barbarians/">barbarian</a> nations in the East and South had gathered an army; and that everywhere men were solidly united in hatred of Maximinus. The emperor's soldiers were in despair and in need of everything. There was scarcely even sufficient water for them.</p><p><span id="8.5.7">[8.5.7]</span>&nbsp;The only source of water was the nearby river, which was fouled by blood and bodies. Lacking any means of burying those who died in the city, the Aquileians threw the bodies into the river; both those who fell in the fighting and those who died of disease were dropped into the stream, as the city had no facilities for burial.</p><p><span id="8.5.8">[8.5.8]</span>&nbsp;And so the completely confused army was in the depths of despair.</p>
<p><span style="color:rgb(0,153,0);">[Early May 238]</span> Then one day, during a lull in the fighting, when most of the soldiers had gone to their quarters or their stations, Maximinus was resting in his tent. Without warning, the soldiers whose camp was near Rome at the foot of Mount Alba,<span class="note-label" onclick="if (!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers) return false; togglenote('note1518824732-1682393594-0');" title="Click to toggle note" data-cf-modified-321a1455f1c23e6982a14742-=""><sup>note</sup></span><span id="note1518824732-1682393594-0" class="note-content" style="display: none;">[The <a href="https://www.livius.org/articles/legion/legio-ii-parthica/">Second Legion Parthica</a>.]</span> where they had left their wives and children, decided that the best solution was to kill Maximinus and end the interminable siege. They resolved no longer to ravage Italy for an emperor they now knew to be a despicable tyrant.</p><p><span id="8.5.9">[8.5.9]</span>&nbsp;Taking courage, therefore, the conspirators went to Maximinus' tent about noon. The imperial bodyguard, which was involved in the plot, ripped Maximinus' pictures from the standards; when he came out of his tent with his son to talk to them, they refused to listen and killed them both. They killed the army's commanding general also, and the emperor's close friends. Their bodies were handed over to those who wished to trample and mutilate them, after which the corpses were exposed to the birds and dogs. The heads of Maximinus and his son were sent to Rome. Such was the fate suffered by Maximinus and his son, who paid the penalty for their savage rule.</p>
